Installing lessc
================

`lessc` is a compiler that generates CSS code from the .less files that
style the widgets. Here are some instruction to install it on Ubuntu
11.04, and it should work on other Debian based distributions. Users of
other distributions should find their way around too:

cd /tmp
sudo apt-get install git-core curl build-essential openssl libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git && cd node
git checkout v0.4.9 # or whatever the latest stable is
./configure && make
sudo make install
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
npm install less
export PATH=$HOME/.npm/less/1.1.4/package/bin:$PATH

You may want to add the final export to your .bashrc and source it.
