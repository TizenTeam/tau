Installing lessc
================

`lessc` is a compiler that generates CSS code from the .less files that
style the widgets. Here are some instruction to install it on Ubuntu
11.04, and it should work on other Debian based distributions. Users of
other distributions should find their way around too:

cd /tmp
sudo apt-get install git-core curl build-essential openssl libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git && cd node
git checkout v0.4.9 # or whatever the latest stable is - last known to work v0.5.0
./configure && make
sudo make install
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
npm install less
export PATH=$HOME/.npm/less/1.1.4/package/bin:$PATH

You may want to add the final export to your .bashrc and source it.



Building
========

***
NB: The development team working on tizen-web-ui-fw uses Linux,
so no one has attempted to build this project on other
platforms.
***

First install lessc (see above).

You'll also need make.

Then, from a command line inside the project directory, do:

  make clean
  make

This compiles the stylesheets for all the widgets using lessc,
then concatenates all the library and widget JavaScript into
framework files.



The widget gallery demo
===============================

You'll need to build the project first (see above).

In a browser, open:

  demos/gallery/index.html

This shows the widgets currently available for the web UI framework.

If you are developing on the widget gallery demo (e.g. writing
widgets), you may want to bypass the framework loader's cache
mechanism (so you get the latest version of every JS file). To
do this, append a debug=true parameter to the URL, e.g.

file://<path>/demos/gallery/index.html?debug=true

where <path> is the full, absolute (with leading /) path to your
checked out copy of the tizen-web-ui-fw repo.

Also note that each time you change your widget code, you'll
need to do "make clean ; make" to rebuild the CSS and JS files.
