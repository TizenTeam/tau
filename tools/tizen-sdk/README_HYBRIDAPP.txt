INTRODUCTION
This CLI name is 'web-hybridapp' for generating hybrid app structure.
(Linux version is supported currently, and Windows version will be supported.)

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
Both a built native service app project path and a web project path are required.

USAGE
$ web-hybridapp [Native service app project path] [Web project path]

EXAMPLES
$ web-hybridapp ~/workspace/hybridserviceapp ~/workspace/hybridwebapp
or
$ web-hybridapp hybridserviceapp hybridwebapp

RESULT
The '.pack' folder will be created under current folder, and the web project name folder will be created under this folder.
For example, if current folder name is '~/workspace' and web project path is '~/workspace/hybridwebapp', the result folder is '~/workspace/.pack/hybridwebapp'.

USEFUL INFORMATION
If Native service app project has a CommandLineBuild binary (a project is generated by CLI), copy this.
If Native service app project has both a Release binary and a Debug binary (a project is generated by IDE), copy a Release binary first. (In this case, a Debug binary is not copied.)
After this CLI process was completed, the next step is to sign the result folder using 'web-signing' CLI and then pack the result folder using 'web-packaging' CLI. Please refer to each detail in Web CLI help documents.
