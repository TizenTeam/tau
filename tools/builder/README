DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
--------------------
All available scripts are placed in folder bin:
    - bin
        - app-build.sh or bin/app-build.bat     - APPLICATION BUILDER
        - build.sh or bin/build.bat             - TAU BUILDER
        - compile.sh or bin/compile.bat
        - lessc.sh or bin/lessc.bat
        - linker.sh or bin/linker.bat
This folder also contains phantomjs executable files.

In folder lib the builder source code and libraries are placed. The main builder source code can be found
in folder lib/builder.


TAU APPLICATION BUILDER
------------------------
If you want to build application, you should run script app-build.sh or app-build.bat. This script takes
three parameters. The first one --source in mandatory and it sets the source of application, which will be built.
In this folder, the valid config.xml filed must be placed. The second parameter --destination is optional
and it sets the destination directory for built application. If this parameter is not given, the built application
will be placed in folder /build in the source directory by default. The last parameter --mode is also optional
and it sets the mode of building process. It can have only one value "multiple". If it has value "multiple",
the all html files in application will be built. By default, only index.html is built.

Options:
    --source="PATH"         The source path of the application; must contain a valid config.xml file
    --destination="PATH"    The destination path of the application
                            (Optional: if not specified, the source + "build" will be used)
    --mode="multiple"       If "multiple", then all html files will be built

Example:
    ./app-build.sh --source="../app" --destination="../app-built" --mode="multiple"


TAU BUILDER
------------
If you want to build TAU framework, you should run script build.sh or build.bat in the main folder of TAU framework.
This script takes two parameters. The first one --profile is optional and can take as a value names of profiles
separated by comma, which should be built. The second parameter --custom-file works and is obligatory if and only if
the first one has value "custom". In this parameter the path for entry file should be given.

Options:
    --profile=NAME       Profile of framework (NAME = wearable|mobile|tv|custom)
    --custom-file=PATH   Path for entry file (it only works with option --profile=custom)

Example:
    ./build.sh --profile="tv,mobile"
